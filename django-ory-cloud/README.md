# Secure a Django application using Ory Cloud

This repo demonstrates how you can use Ory Cloud or Ory Kratos with Django apps. This app is not for production use and serves as
an example of integration.

## Overview

- Generated using the default `django-admin startproject` command.
- Uses sqlite3 as the database backend.
- Consider using [django-cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django)

## Develop

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10
1. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - Python dependency manager.
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (if you want to self-host Ory Kratos)
